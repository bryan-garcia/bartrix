# bartrix

BART dashboard using LED matrix screen and esp32.

# Requirements

1. Have Espressif IDF installed on your system. [Installation Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/linux-macos-setup.html)

2. Project is integrated with VS Code. Recommended but not required.

3. Have the `IDF_PATH` environment variable set. Example: `$HOME/esp/v5.5.1/esp-idf`

# Architecture

1. gtfs-tester: python application to prototype using gtfs protocol and bart feed.
2. bartrix-target: Esp32 application that will ingest bart feed and display to matrix.
3. bartrix-sim: C++ application that will be used to prototype gtfs protocol and bart feed.

# Documentation

# Getting Started

The project is well integrated with VS Code. There are tasks configured to build the application for host or embedded, and intellisense setup for both projects.

> [!NOTE]
> The C/C++ intellisense works off the compile_commands.json generated by CMake which only gets produced at build time. Once you have those generated, the intellisense will work. You can switch between C/C++ configurations by "(Ctrl+Shift+P) Type and select C/C++: Select a Configuration...."
